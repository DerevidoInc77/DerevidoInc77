Hello, my name is Cal Farrell Woods and I am 
21 years old and I live in Drogheda, Ireland. 
I went to PLC college in Drogheda, County 
Louth, Ireland for two years where I received 
two QQI level five awards in: Multimedia with 
photography and Games Development. I also have 
an extensive two year portfolio from both 
courses that each lasted a year. During the 
time of my games development course, I did my 
mandatory work experience at the college of: 
Drogheda Institute of Further Education on 
Rathmullan Road in Drogheda, Ireland, I was 
assistant to the IT department at the college, which I was 
attending at the time. 

Whilst I was doing my work experience, 
I designed a website; first, I designed it with 
client side JavaScript in order to test it 
before applying server side PHP functionality.
